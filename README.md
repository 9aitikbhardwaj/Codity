# 🏗️ System Architecture

```
                    React Frontend
                           │
              REST API + Socket.IO
                           │
                 Express API Server
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼─────────────────┐
        │                  │                 │
   Scheduler           Worker(s)         Analytics
        │                  │
        └──────────────┬───┘
                       │
                    MySQL Database
```

The system consists of four independent components:

- React Dashboard
- Express REST API
- Scheduler Service
- Worker Cluster

All services communicate through a shared MySQL database.
